Luis-Race Car AI, made and AI model that uses a survival algorithm to teach the cars how to go around a track the most efficiently. Then, at the end, use the best car in the model to show how to go around. Every generation was better than the other the current generation learns from previous hence improving the model

Sreeram - I created a decision support system for predicting air quality using reccurent neural networks. Air pollution prediction is done by using LSTM model that is well suited for time prediction tasks.
